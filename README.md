# Question 1

(lower case) and have exactly 3 letters.

The program asks the user to build the List.
In the building process, the word to terminate the creation is 'close', so the programa asks if the user wants to include 'close' in the list or not.
After that, the program selects the list elements that fit the informed filter.
